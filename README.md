# X-Pick

This Android Application is instantiated based on the code base of "Sensor data collector" which is developed by Timo and for Universit√§t Mannheim. Current Version of the application can be seen both on Github and Playstore. We are using this application for the base of our teamproject in which we have to use the sensor data to track the picking process and detect the movement and objects.

This is an Android application that allows to record all common build-in sensors of the wearable device (smart-phone and smart-watch). It is possible to specifiy the sampling rate and record several sensors simultaneously. In addition, it is possible to label the recorded data by specifying the current activity, posture, and location. The recorded data can be visualized as well as exported in several formats.

# Features

The App allows to record, label, and visualize all common sensors. This includes: accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, GPS, magnetic field, microphone (sound-level), orientation, pressure, proximity, humidity, and video.
Primary Features of "Sensor Data Collector" as in our Project "X-Pick":
<ul>
  <li>recording of all build-in sensors (simultaneously)</li>
  <li>labeling recorded data (activity, location, posture)</li>
  <li>visualize recorded data as well as supports live plotting</li>
  <li>supports smart-watches (Android Wear) (sensor recording, additional interface)</li>
</ul> 

# Requirements
<ul>
  <li>at least Android 4.1</li>
</ul>
